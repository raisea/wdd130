	 <p>Hello My name is Romeo Aisea. I am from Marshall Islands. I am pursuing for a Bacelor degree
		I love read and playing basketball. 
        I am married and having four kids. I have three sons and one daughter. I am currently working as IT Officer.
	    What I really like most about 
		BYU-Idaho is the student portal which is very organize and make many online-students become cabaple of doing their assignments.
